This webpage was created to make estimates at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, when prevalence was relatively low. At this time, the growth rate was also roughly constant because social distancing measures were not yet widely implemented. The model relied upon these assumptions, and now that they do not hold in most states. As the model is no longer applicable, it has been taken down.
